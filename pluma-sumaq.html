		<p class="epigraph"><span class="notitalic">'I propose to consider a dimension of political life that has to do with our exposure to violence and our complicity in it, with our vulnerability to loss and the task of mourning that follows, and with finding a basis for community in these conditions. ’ </span>was an invitation to <br>the gesture of breaking the expected chains of events,<br>to release the compressed potentialities. <br>It was a blow to the fucked up love affairs, to<br>ordinary prostitution.<br>It was a call at overcoming the couple as elementary unit in the management of<br>alienation.</p>
		<p class="epigraph-attribution">Judith Butler, from Precarious Life</p>
		<p>In conversations with communities of color regarding prostitution I am confronted with what oftentimes feels like outright hatred or dis-gust for people in the sex trade. I am, however, also presented with a lot of legitimate concerns. The sentiment that, “it’s different in our communities” and “women of color do not enjoy the same privilege of empowerment as white women do” are echoed over and over again. As a woman of color in the sex industry who has encountered the paradox of both financial stability or at least disposable income, alongside many hardships in this profession, I can say that much of these hardships were a direct result of how we as a culture tend to perceive women of color when they take on something as perverse as any combination of sex, money and economic struggle.</p>
		<p>I grew up with ideas, images and stereotypes regarding prostitution like any other first generation woman of color attempting to represent all the goodness of her race in every scrutinized endeavor. My parents wanted more than anything for their youngest daughter to grow up to become a lawyer, a doctor or a business owner. They imagined that for all their hard work and sacrifices, for the three jobs my mother worked, and all the times they ate less so that we could have more, their children would, in the end, be in a position to be in charge and demand respect. In many black and brown communities a parent’s worst nightmare is to have dignity stripped from them by knowing that their children are in a worse position than they were in when they brought us into this world. For many of our communities, failure is synonymous with the continuation of poverty, with dependency and disempowerment, with addiction and dysfunction. For many of us, prostitution epitomizes these very things.</p>
		<p>My initial experiences in the sex trade at 17 were coercive to say the least. I have since worked in and experienced a broad range of both sex acts and financial status within what we call the sex industry. But regardless of my experience in backdoor strip clubs, indoor incalls, as an independent escort or in the backseat of a vehicle, I have carried with me the markers of my race, my family’s class background and innumerable stereotypes as well as stories about the meaning of success and morality that have penetrated me from all angles. I have experienced suspicion from clients and neighbors because of the way I looked, the way I dressed, the questions I asked. I have lived through dysfunctional relationships with both money and sex, as well as a dangerous com-bination of the two. I have spent entirely too much of my sex-work-earned money on drugs, and on bailing family members out of jail and countless financial crises. I know what it is like to “have a problem,” as well as what it means to find a solution. I know what it is like to be unable to escape the way wealthier and white people perceive me. </p>
